**Repository**: **https://github.com/lordabrax/saifu-monorepo**

**Description**: Saifu gives you the possibility to lock away your assets with the future price or future time targets to prevent you from selling too early or impulsively. You can withdraw your assets at any time, but there is a fine that prevents you from fulfilling your initial impulsive action. 100% of these paperhand action's fines go to $SAIFU stakers.

## 3 Simple Steps To Never Paperhand

In 3 simple steps, it is possible to save your CANTO, ETH or ERC20 funds from emotional decisions:

- Choose how much you want to lock up and enter your price or time target.
- Once locked in, your funds will wait for the price or time goal to be reached. During this time, your assets are safe from decisions made out of fear or greed.
- If one of your Targets (Price or Time) was hit - your assets are now unlocked and you have access to them again.

## Saifu Punks

In addition to locking mechanism, it is possible to earn $SAIFU token (available in the future iterations) by having one of the Saifu Punks, all features of which are hand made by our talented artist Zullup (https://twitter.com/ZullupFromSpace) and inspired by OG CryptoPunks (not affiliated with LarvaLabs, it's our own art derivative).

10k Saifu Punks NFTs produce our utility token $SAIFU. The amount of tokens you can claim depends on the rarity of the punk you own. These tokens can be staked to earn a share of the fines paid by the paperhands.
