## DexFinance COH Chapter 1 Season 6 Submission:

DexFinance developed cross-chain vault migration for our dexVAULTS.com product.

DexVAULTS are an innovative solution designed to make decentralized finance more accessible and secure for users. By employing auto-compounding vaults, dexVAULTS automate complex trading strategies, allowing you to focus on maximizing your returns across multiple DeFi platforms.

These vaults handle tasks like auto-balancing and profit-taking on your behalf, so you don't have to worry about managing these strategies yourself. Each vault can consist of 1 to 3 farms, with varying levels of risk and reward to suit your preferences.

## Problem Statement:

Most cryptocurrency investors start trading crypto assets on CEXes. Of those, a small portion of of potential Web3 users make their way off the CEX and into DeFi. This transition is typically difficult for new users as the current state of Web3 decentralized finance is quite disjointed between different Web3 projects.

DexFinance aims to simplify the Web3 journey, encouraging users to move on-chain and away from centralized entities. For these users, moving funds from blockchain to blockchain is especially worisome. Bridges are a key exploit vector, and users need to find trustworthy bridges to move their assets from chain to chain.

## Some key features:

By utilizing the newly developed Synapse SDK, we have developed cross-chain vault migration withint our dexVAULTS.com product. No longer do users need to withdraw funds, manually bridge to Canto, and then deposit funds back into a vault. Now users can perform all of these actions through a few simple clicks and transaction approvals to seamlessly bridge funds from a vault on another chain to a vault on Canto.
